	<td>Corrected 3/16 at 3:00pm  **The Pasadena Health Department case was reported this morning, not yesterday.**    <P>
LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public   Health (Public Health) has confirmed 25 new cases of 2019   Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Because testing limitations   still exist, the best approach is to practice social   distancing at every opportunity, assuming that many   people can be infected.    <P>
Additional case information:  <ul><li>Five cases have an unidentified source of   exposure.  <li>One case was exposed during recent travel.  <li>One case had close contact with a confirmed case.  <li>Seventeen of these cases are pending more   investigation.  <li>One is the case reported by the Pasadena Health   Department this morning.</ul>    <P>
To date, Public Health has identified 94 cases; of these,   15 cases are likely due to community transmission. Two of   the cases confirmed today were hospitalized. Cases are   occurring across LA County, so everyone should be aware   and practice social distancing.     <P>
Public Health is investigating these cases and will   notify close contacts who are household members, intimate   partners and healthcare professionals to assess and   monitor them for signs and symptoms of illness. All   confirmed cases are being isolated and close contacts are   quarantined.    <P>
“We are seeing a significant increase in cases and   evidence of  community spread as more testing occurs,”   said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Los Angeles County   Public Health Director. “We are implementing more social   distancing requirements and we expect everyone to do   their part."    <P>
Public Health has issued the following guidance during   this time of increased spread:  <ul><li>Avoid non-essential travel, public gatherings,   and places where large groups of people congregate.  <li>Event organizers postpone or cancel non-essential   gatherings of 50 or more until at least the end of March.  <li>Limit gatherings of individuals who are at higher   risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (people older than   65, pregnant women, and those with chronic illness) to no   more than 10 people.  <li>This guidance does not apply to activities such as   attendance at regular school classes, work, or essential   services, including public transportation, airport travel   or shopping.  <li>If you are mildly sick with a fever, stay home and   call your doctor if you are concerned and/or your   symptoms worsen. Individuals who are elderly, have   underlying health conditions or pregnant should consider   contacting their providers earlier when they are sick.  <li>Exclude employees and visitors with any fever and/or   respiratory infection symptoms and visitors with recent   travel to any country or region with significant   community transmission (including communities in the US)   from all schools, businesses, and gatherings of any size.   <li>Follow all social distancing recommendations issued   by Public Health.</ul>    <P>
Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your   family and your community are on the Public Health   website.    <P>
  Please see the locations were cases have occurred:     <P>
