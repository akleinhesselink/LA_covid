	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public   Health (Public Health) has confirmed nine new deaths and   421 new cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).   Additional information regarding some of the new cases is   pending further investigation. Over the last 48 hours   there have been 559 new cases.    <P>
To date, Public Health has identified 1216 cases across   all areas of LA County, including 21 deaths.  Upon further   investigation, one death and four cases reported earlier   were not LA County residents. As of today, 253 positive   cases (21% of positive cases) have been hospitalized.    <P>
Yesterday, Health Officer Orders were issued to ensure   that individuals who test positive for COVID-19, and those   who are told by a clinician they are presumed to be   positive for COVID-19 are required to self-isolate for a   period of 7 days and 3 days of being symptom free.    Additionally, those who have been in close contact with   someone who is positive or presumed positive must   quarantine themselves for 14 days from their last exposure   to that person. It is critically important that everyone   adheres to all the social distancing measures and practice   good public health hygiene, including washing hands as   frequently as possible.    <P>
“We are sad to report these nine additional deaths today -   it is the highest daily number we've released to date,”   said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Los Angeles County   Public Health Director. “Unfortunately, we have been   expecting this.  To the families and loved ones, we are   deeply sorry for your loss. This dramatic increase in   cases is due in part to increased testing capacity in LA   County which is allowing us to identify more positive   cases.  In order to slow the spread and save lives, all of   us must do our part by staying home, adhering to all   social distancing measures and caring for each other."    <P>
  Public Health has issued the following guidance during this time of increased spread:  <ul><li>If you are mildly sick, stay home for at least seven days or until 72 hours after being fever free, whichever is longer. Call your doctor if you are concerned and/or your symptoms worsen. Individuals who are elderly, have underlying health conditions or pregnant should consider contacting their providers earlier when they are sick.</ul>    <P>
Public Health reminds LA County residents to do their part and adhere to the Order by always practicing social distancing.    <P>
  Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your community are on the Public Health website.    <P>
