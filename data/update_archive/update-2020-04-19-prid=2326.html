	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) has confirmed 81 new deaths and 642 new cases of 2019   Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This is the highest number of daily reported deaths in LA County to date, and the total number of deaths   attributed to COVID-19 almost doubled this past week. Over the last 48 hours, there have been 1,209 new cases. Fifty-six people who died   were over the age of 65; 18 people who died were between the ages of 41 to 65 years old; one person who died was between the ages of 18   to 40 years old. Sixty-three people who died had underlying health conditions; 52 people over the age of 65; 10 people between the ages   of 41 to 65 years old; and one person between the ages of 18 to 40 years old. Two deaths were reported by the city of Long Beach and   four deaths were reported by the city of Pasadena.    <P>
To date, Public Health has identified 12,021 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of LA County, and a total of 576 deaths.   Eighty-nine percent of people who died had underlying health conditions. Of those who died, information about race and ethnicity is   available for 498 people (93 percent of the cases); 36% of deaths occurred among Latinx residents, 29% among White residents, 17% among   Asian residents, 16% among African American residents, and 3% among residents identifying with other races. Upon further investigation,   12 cases reported earlier were not LA County residents. As of today, 3,280 people who tested positive for COVID-19 (27% of positive   cases) have been hospitalized at some point during their illness. Testing capacity continues to increase in LA County, with testing   results available for over 76,000 individuals and 14% of people testing positive.     <P>
“Today marks a very sad milestone for our County, we are reporting the highest number of COVID-19 deaths for any one day since the   beginning of the pandemic, and our deepest condolences go out to each and every person grieving the loss of their loved ones,” said   Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “In this last week we have doubled the number of deaths that occurred among LA   County residents. We are especially concerned about the overwhelming number of residents residing in our nursing homes who have passed   away. I have requested additional support from our state and federal partners so we can work together to ensure that our nursing homes   are as safe as possible for residents and employees. This includes asking for supplementary staffing and PPE, increased ability to test   residents and employees, and improvements in infection control capacity at nursing homes.”       <P>
Public Health reminds everyone that if you are ill, even with mild symptoms, please self- isolate at home for 7 days and until you are   fever and symptom free for 72 hours. If you have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is presumed   to be infected with COVID-19, you must quarantine for 14 days from your last contact with that individual. Individuals who are elderly,   have underlying health conditions or are pregnant may be at higher risk of serious illness and should contact their doctor as soon as   they are sick.     <P>
The best protection against COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands,   self-isolate if you are sick, practice physical distancing (especially by staying at home) and wear a clean face covering when out in   the public procuring or providing essential services. N95 and surgical masks should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders   and essential workers providing care for people who are ill. The current Health Officer Order extends the previous Health Officer Order   through May 15 and requires essential businesses to provide a cloth face covering for all employees to wear while performing duties that   involve contact with other employees and or the public and to post physical distancing plans. The public is required to wear a face   covering to enter essential businesses as well.     <P>
Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your community are on the Public Health website,   www.publichealth.lacounty.gov.    <P>
