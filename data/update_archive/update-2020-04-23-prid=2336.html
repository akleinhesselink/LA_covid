	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) has confirmed 68 new deaths and 1,081 new cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Fifty-one   people who died were over the age of 65; 11 people who died were between the ages of 41 to 65 years old, and three people who died were between the ages of 18 to 40 years old. Fifty-  one people had underlying health conditions including 40 people over the age of 65, nine people between the ages of 41 to 65 years old and two people between the ages of 18 to 40   years old. Three deaths were reported by the City of Long Beach.    <P>
To date, Public Health has identified 17,508 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of LA County, and a total of 797 deaths. Eighty-nine percent of people who died had   underlying health conditions. Of those who died, information about race and ethnicity is available for 716 people (96 percent of the cases); 37% of deaths occurred among Latinx   residents, 28% among White residents, 18% among Asian residents, 15% among African American residents, and 2% among residents identifying with other races. Upon further   investigation, eight cases reported earlier were not LA County residents. As of today, 4,053 people who tested positive for COVID-19 (24% of positive cases) have been hospitalized at   some point during their illness. Testing capacity continues to increase in LA County, with testing results available for almost 99,000 individuals and 14% of people testing positive.     <P>
High temperatures have been forecast for many areas throughout LA County. As the Safer at Home Order remains in effect, Public Health would like to remind everyone that precautions   should be taken to avoid heat-related illness, especially by older adults, young children, outdoor workers, athletes, and people with a chronic medical condition, among others, who   are especially sensitive to negative health impacts from extreme heat. Public Health offers the following recommendations during high temperatures:  </ul><li>Drink plenty of water and keep hydrated throughout the day.  <li>If you must go out, plan your day to avoid going out during the hottest hours, and wear sunscreen. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothes, and bring a hat or umbrella with   you.  <li>Cars get very hot. Don't leave children or pets in cars, and call 911 if you see a child or pet in a car alone.  <li>Beware of heat-related illness, like heat stroke and call 911 if you see these symptoms: high body temperature, vomiting, and pale and clammy skin.  <li>Check on those at risk, like the sick, older adults, pregnant women, and children.  <li>Avoid working out wearing face coverings or masks not intended for athletic purposes; this means avoiding contact with others while you work out.</ul>    <P>
Public Health and County partners are planning on ways to safely open cooling centers if the need arises.    <P>
  “So many in LA County are mourning people who have passed away from COVID-19. We are deeply sorry for your loss, and you are in our thoughts and prayers every day,” said Barbara   Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “COVID-19 is rapidly becoming one of the leading causes of death among LA County residents.  On average, 44 people are dying each   day from COVID-19. This is significantly higher than the five people who die each day from the flu and 31 people who die from coronary heart disease."    <P>
Public Health reminds everyone that if you are ill, even with mild symptoms, please self- isolate at home for 7 days and until you are fever and symptom free for 72 hours. If you   have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is presumed to be infected with COVID-19, you must quarantine for 14 days from your last contact with   that individual. Individuals who are elderly or who have underlying health conditions may be at higher risk of serious illness and should contact their doctor as soon as they are   sick.     <P>
The best protection against COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, self-isolate if you are sick, practice physical   distancing (especially by staying at home) and wear a clean face covering when in contact with others from outside your household.  Essential employees are required to wear cloth   face coverings while performing duties that involve contact with other employees and or the public and businesses are required to post physical distancing plans. The public is   required to wear a face covering to enter essential businesses as well. N95 and surgical masks should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders and essential workers   providing care for people who are ill.    <P>
Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your community are on the Public Health website,   <a   href="http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov">www.publichealth.lacounty.gov </a>.    <P>

Eight previously reported cases were not in Public Health's jurisdiction.  **-- means that case numbers are suppressed (between 1 and 4 cases in communities <25,000 people).   ***Rate is crude and is per 100,000. This represents the number of cases per 100,000 people and allows for the proportional comparison of cities of different sizes.    <P>
