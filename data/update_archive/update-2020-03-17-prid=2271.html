	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public   Health (Public Health) has confirmed 50 new cases of 2019   Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) to date. The public should   not think one location is safer than the other.     <P>
Additional case information:  <ul><li>One case had close contact with a confirmed case.  <li>49 of these cases are pending more investigation.   </ul>    <P>
To date, Public Health has identified 144 cases across   all areas in LA County, so everyone should be aware and   practice social distancing.     <P>
Public Health is investigating these cases and will   notify close contacts who are household members, intimate   partners and healthcare professionals to assess and   monitor them for signs and symptoms of illness. All   confirmed cases are being isolated and close contacts are   quarantined.    <P>
“We understand that there is a lot of concern as these   numbers keep rising and we want to reiterate that as we   do more testing, we will continue to find more positive   for COVID-19,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Los   Angeles County Public Health Director. “It is more   important than ever for us to continue to practice social   distancing, and as we do, to care for the most vulnerable   among us especially seniors within our individual   communities. We are all in this together."    <P>
Public Health issued a Health Officer Order to prohibit   group events and gatherings, require social distancing   measures and the closure of certain businesses, including   bars, gyms, movie theaters and entertainment centers. The   <a   href="  http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/COVID-19_TemporaryProhibitionofGroupEventsandGatheringsandClosureofCertainBusiness_HealthOfficerOrder_20200316_Signed.pdf">Order </a> along with  <a   href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/GuidanceHealthOfficerOrder.pdf">guidance</a>  can be found online:<a   href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/"> http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/</a>    <P>
Public Health has issued the following guidance during   this time of increased spread:  <ul><li>Avoid non-essential travel, public gatherings,   and places where large groups of people congregate.  <li>Event organizers postpone or cancel non-essential   gatherings of 50 or more until at least the end of March.  <li>For gatherings of less than 50 people, social   distancing measures must be followed.  <li>Limit gatherings of individuals who are at higher   risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (people older than   65, pregnant women, and those with chronic illness) to no   more than 10 people.  <li>This guidance does not apply to activities such   as attendance at regular school classes, work, or   essential services, including public transportation,   airport travel or shopping.  <li>If you are mildly sick with a fever, stay home   and call your doctor if you are concerned and/or your   symptoms worsen. Individuals who are elderly, have   underlying health conditions or pregnant should consider   contacting their providers earlier when they are sick.  <li>Exclude employees and visitors with any fever   and/or respiratory infection symptoms and visitors with   recent travel to any country or region with significant   community transmission (including communities in the US)   from all schools, businesses, and gatherings of any size.  <li>Follow all social distancing recommendations   issued by Public Health.</ul>    <P>
