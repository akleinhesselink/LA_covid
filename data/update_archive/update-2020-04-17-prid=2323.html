	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) has confirmed 40 new deaths   and 567 new cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Over the last 48 hours, there have been 966 new cases.   Twenty-eight people who died were over the age of 65; eight people who died were between the ages of 41 to 65   years old; one death occurred between the ages of 18 to 40 years old; and one death is under investigation.   Twenty-six people had underlying health conditions; nine people over the age of 65 and two people between the   ages of 41 to 65 years old had no reported underlying health conditions. Two deaths were reported by the City   of Pasadena.    <P>
To date, Public Health has identified 11,391 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of LA County, and a   total of 495 deaths. Eighty-seven percent of people who died had underlying health conditions. Of those who   died, information about race and ethnicity is available for 425 people (92 percent of the cases); 34% of   deaths occurred among Latinx residents, 29% among White residents, 18% among Asian residents, 16% among   African American residents, and 3% among residents identifying with other races. Upon further investigation,   30 cases reported earlier were not LA County residents. As of today, 3,014 people who tested positive for   COVID-19 (26% of positive cases) have been hospitalized at some point during their illness. Testing capacity   continues to increase in LA County, with testing results available for over 74,000 individuals and 14% of   people testing positive.     <P>
“We are saddened by every life lost in LA County during this global crisis, and our hearts go out the loved   ones who are mourning. We mourn with you,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health.   “Each day, we are inspired by all of you who are continuing to do your part to slow the spread of COVID-19.    It is an unprecedented time, and so many have shown courage, goodwill and compassion as our lives have all   changed dramatically and we’ve all been affected in different ways. These times are tough, but they are   temporary. Remaining committed to the strategies that are helping us gradually get ahead of COVID-19, we will,   one day at a time, get through this together.”    <P>
The best protection against COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and   mouth with unwashed hands, self-isolate if you are sick, practice physical distancing (especially by staying   at home) and wear a clean face covering when out in the public procuring or providing essential services. N95   and surgical masks should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders and essential workers providing   care for people who are ill. The current Health Officer Order extends the previous Health Officer Order   through May 15 and requires essential businesses to provide a cloth face covering for all employees to wear   while performing duties that involve contact with other employees and or the public and to post physical   distancing plans. The public is required to wear a face covering to enter essential businesses as well.   Beaches, trails and trailheads and non-essential businesses remain closed, and all public and private   gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single household or living unit remain prohibited.   Slowing the spread of COVID-19 requires that the public adhere to all the directives that limit interactions   with those outside their households.    <P>
Public Health reminds everyone that if you are ill, even with mild symptoms, please self- isolate at home for   7 days and until you are fever and symptom free for 72 hours. If you have been in close contact with a person   who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is presumed to be infected with COVID-19, you must quarantine for 14   days from your last contact with that individual. Individuals who are elderly, have underlying health   conditions or are pregnant may be at higher risk of serious illness and should contact their doctor as soon as   they are sick.     <P>
  Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your community are on the Public Health   website, <a   href="http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov">www.publichealth.lacounty.gov </a>.    <P>

*These numbers are subject to change based on further investigation. Forty-one cases and two deaths previously   reported   cases were not in Public Health's jurisdiction.  **-- means that case numbers are suppressed (between 1 and 4 cases in communities <25,000 people).   ***Rate is crude and is per 100,000. This represents the number of cases per 100,000 people and allows for the 				  proportional comparison of cities of different sizes.    <P>
