	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public   Health (Public Health) has confirmed a second death and   40 new cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).  The   death occurred in an individual in their 30's with   underlying health conditions from an unincorporated area   outside of Pasadena.  Because there are positive cases   across the entire County, the public should not think one   location is safer than the other.  Additional information   regarding some of the new cases are pending completion of   an investigation.    <P>
  To date, Public Health has identified 231 cases across   all areas in LA County, so everyone needs to practice   social distancing and good public health hygiene.    <P>
  Public Health is investigating these cases and will   notify close contacts who are household members, intimate   partners and healthcare professionals to assess and   monitor them for signs and symptoms of illness. All   confirmed cases are being isolated and close contacts are   quarantined.    <P>
  “Public Health extends our deepest condolences to the   individual's loved ones in the wake of this tragedy,"   said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Los Angeles County   Public Health Director. "In these uncertain times, one   thing is clear; the spread of COVID-19 is broad. Everyone   should assume that anyone can have COVID-19, and anyone   could unintentionally infect others. Therefore, we are   imploring everyone who can, to stay home and stay safe."     <P>
  Public Health issued a Health Officer Order to prohibit   group events and gatherings, require social distancing   measures and the closure of certain businesses, including   bars, gyms, movie theaters and entertainment centers. The   <a   href="  http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/COVID-19_TemporaryProhibitionofGroupEventsandGatheringsandClosureofCertainBusiness_HealthOfficerOrder_20200316_Signed.pdf">Order </a> along with  <a   href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/GuidanceHealthOfficerOrder.pdf">guidance</a>  can be found online:<a   href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/  ">   http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/</a>    <P>
Public Health has issued the following guidance during   this time of increased spread:  <ul><li>Avoid non-essential travel, public gatherings,   and places where large groups of people congregate.  <li>Event organizers postpone or cancel non-essential   gatherings of 50 or more until at least the end of March.  <li>For gatherings of less than 50 people, social   distancing measures must be followed.  <li>Limit gatherings of individuals who are at higher   risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (people older than   65, pregnant women, and those with chronic illness) to no   more than 10 people.  <li>This guidance does not apply to activities such   as attendance at regular school classes, work, or   essential services, including public transportation,   airport travel or shopping.  <li>If you are mildly sick with a fever, stay home   and call your doctor if you are concerned and/or your   symptoms worsen. Individuals who are elderly, have   underlying health conditions or pregnant should consider   contacting their providers earlier when they are sick.  <li>Exclude employees and visitors with any fever   and/or respiratory infection symptoms and visitors with   recent travel to any country or region with significant   community transmission (including communities in the US)   from all schools, businesses, and gatherings of any size.  <li>Follow all social distancing recommendations   issued by Public Health.</ul>    <P>
  Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your   family and your community are on the Public Health   website.    <P>
