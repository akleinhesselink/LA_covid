	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) has confirmed 66 new deaths and 1,318 new cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).   Forty-eight people who died were over the age of 65; 13 people who died were between the ages of 41 to 65 years old, and two people who died were between the ages of 18   to 40 years old. Forty-nine people had underlying health conditions including 38 people over the age of 65, nine people between the ages of 41 to 65 years old and two   people between the ages of 18 to 40 years old. Three deaths were reported by the City of Pasadena.    <P>
  To date, Public Health has identified 16,435 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of LA County, and a total of 729 deaths. Eighty-eight percent of people who died   had underlying health conditions. Of those who died, information about race and ethnicity is available for 646 people (95 percent of the cases); 37% of deaths occurred   among Latinx residents, 27% among White residents, 18% among Asian residents, 15% among African American residents, and 2% among residents identifying with other races.   Upon further investigation, 23 cases reported earlier were not LA County residents. As of today, 3,902 people who tested positive for COVID-19 (24% of positive cases)   have been hospitalized at some point during their illness. Testing capacity continues to increase in LA County, with testing results available for almost 91,000   individuals and 15% of people testing positive.     <P>
Public Health continues to receive a backlog of test results. In an effort to expand testing capacity, many new labs are responding to the emergency and Public Health is   working with them to ensure that they have the proper reporting systems in place. Until this reporting issue is resolved, there may be periodic increases in positive   cases and total cases due to unevenness in daily reporting.    <P>
“As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we are reminded that we are all part of one humanity united in our efforts to recover from this pandemic. Sadly, 66   additional people died from COVID-19, and our sincere condolences go out to every person affected by these losses,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public   Health. “We know that with the return of beautiful weather we all want to be outside - and it is fine do so – as long as you are not gathering with others. Enjoy a walk   or a jog, or sit outside and enjoy the sunshine at your home. Our beaches and trails remain closed as we continue to work together to slow the spread."    <P>
Public Health reminds everyone that if you are ill, even with mild symptoms, please self- isolate at home for 7 days and until you are fever and symptom free for 72   hours. If you have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is presumed to be infected with COVID-19, you must quarantine for 14 days   from your last contact with that individual. Individuals who are elderly, and have underlying health conditions may be at higher risk of serious illness and should   contact their doctor as soon as they are sick.     <P>
    <P>
The best protection against COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, self-isolate if you are sick,   practice physical distancing (especially by staying at home) and wear a clean face covering when out in the public procuring or providing essential services.  The current   Health Officer Order requires essential businesses to provide a cloth face covering for all employees to wear while performing duties that involve contact with other   employees and or the public and to post physical distancing plans. The public is required to wear a face covering to enter essential businesses as well. N95 and surgical   masks should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders and essential workers providing care for people who are ill.    <P>
Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your community are on the Public Health website, <a   href="http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov">www.publichealth.lacounty.gov </a>.    <P>

Twenty-three previously reported cases were not in Public Health's jurisdiction.  **-- means that case numbers are suppressed (between 1 and 4 cases in communities <25,000 people).   ***Rate is crude and is per 100,000. This represents the number of cases per 100,000 people and allows for the proportional comparison of cities of different sizes.    <P>
