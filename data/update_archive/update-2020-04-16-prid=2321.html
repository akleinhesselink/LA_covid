	<td>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) has confirmed 55 new deaths and 399 new   cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This is the largest increase in new deaths for the third consecutive day. Over   the last 48 hours, there have been 871 new cases. Forty-three people who died were over the age of 65; 9 people who died   were between the ages of 41 to 65 years old. Forty-eight people had underlying health conditions, while four people over the   age of 65 had no reported underlying health conditions. One death was reported by the City of Long Beach and two deaths by   the City of Pasadena.     <P>
To date, Public Health has identified 10,854 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of LA County, and a total of 455   deaths. Eighty-eight percent of people who died had underlying health conditions. Of those who died, information about race   and ethnicity is available for 390 people (92 percent of the cases); 33% of deaths occurred among Latinx residents, 31%   among White residents, 17% among Asian residents, 16% among African American residents, and 3% among residents identifying   with other races. Upon further investigation, 41 cases and two deaths reported earlier were not LA County residents. As of   today, 2,847 people who tested positive for COVID-19 (26% of positive cases) have been hospitalized at some point during   their illness. Testing capacity continues to increase in LA County, with testing results available for over 70,000   individuals and 11% of people testing positive.     <P>
“The increase this week on the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 is distressing and a stark reminder of the   devastation caused by COVID-19,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Public Health is planning   for our County’s eventual recovery and preparing for a time when we can ease the Health Officer Orders. Our goal is to get   people back to work by gradually relaxing restrictions in a measured and disciplined way to avoid experiencing a resurgence   of cases that overwhelms our healthcare system and threatens our collective wellbeing. Many routines will still be   different, and practicing physical distancing, wearing face coverings, and keeping our hands clean will be very important   until we have a vaccine.”      <P>
The best protection against COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with   unwashed hands, self-isolate if you are sick, practice physical distancing (especially by staying at home) and wear a clean   face covering when out in the public procuring or providing essential services. N95 and surgical masks should only be used   by healthcare workers, first responders and essential workers providing care for people who are ill.    <P>
The current Health Officer Order extends the previous Health Officer Order through May 15 and requires essential businesses   to provide a cloth face covering for all employees to wear while performing duties that involve contact with other employees   and or the public and to post physical distancing plans. The public is required to wear a face covering to enter essential   businesses as well. Beaches, trails and trailheads and non-essential businesses remain closed, and all public and private   gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single household or living unit remain prohibited. Slowing the spread   of COVID-19 requires that the public adhere to all the directives that limit interactions with those outside their   households.    <P>
Public Health reminds everyone that if you are ill, even with mild symptoms, please self- isolate at home for 7 days and   until you are fever and symptom free for 72 hours. If you have been in close contact with a person who has   tested positive for COVID-19 or is presumed to be infected with COVID-19, you must quarantine for 14 days from your last   contact with that individual. Individuals who are elderly, have underlying health conditions or are   pregnant may be at higher risk of serious illness and should contact their doctor as soon as they are sick.     <P>
Additional things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your community are on the Public Health website, <a   href="http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov">www.publichealth.lacounty.gov </a>.    <P>

*These numbers are subject to change based on further investigation. Forty-one cases and two deaths previously reported   cases were not in Public Health's jurisdiction.  **-- means that case numbers are suppressed (between 1 and 4 cases in communities <25,000 people).   ***Rate is crude and is per 100,000. This represents the number of cases per 100,000 people and allows for the 				  proportional comparison of cities of different sizes.    <P>
