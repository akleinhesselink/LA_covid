	<td>LOS ANGELES – Today the Los Angeles County Health Officer   (Health Officer) issued an order to prohibit all indoor   and outdoor, public and private events and gatherings   within a confined space, where 50 or more members of the   public are expected to attend at the same time, to   require social distancing measures and temporary closure   of certain businesses.  The decision for the Order is   based on evidence of increasing community transmission   requiring the immediate implementation of additional   community mitigation efforts for organizations to help   reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the county. This   Order will remain in effect at least through March 31,   2020.    <P>
To further protect against the spread of COVID-19, the   Health Officer's Order also requires persons in charge of   events and gatherings attended by 10-49 persons to ensure   that attendees follow specific social distancing   measures, as well as, follow infection control guidelines   for the duration of the event and prohibits dining in at   restaurants.  Restaurants may continue to serve food to   customer via delivery, take-out or drive-thru.    Furthermore, the Order requires the closing of businesses   where it is common for patrons to be in close contact   with each other for extended periods of time, such as,   movie theaters, gyms and fitness centers, arcades,   bowling alleys and bars and nightclubs that do not serve   food.     <P>
“Chairwoman Kathryn Barger continues to take swift action   to protect the more than 10 million individuals in Los   Angeles County. I would like to thank all the local   leaders who are working tirelessly to address what is a   quickly changing situation here in Los Angeles County.    Our goal is to slow the transmission of COVID-19, but we   can't do it alone,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd,   Director of Public Health. “Each and every one of us,   both businesses and residents, must do our part by   practicing social distancing and taking common sense   infection control precautions. We urgently need to   flatten the curve of COVID-19 in order to keep our   hospitals and emergency rooms from becoming overwhelmed   with COVID-19 patients.  Flattening the curve requires   conscientious social distancing efforts by all our LA   County residents during this time of crisis.  Our   collective efforts during this pandemic can literally   save the lives of our loved ones and most vulnerable   residents."      <P>
"This Order is designed to implement both the Center for   Disease Control’s (CDC) Interim Guidance for Large Events   and Mass Gatherings and the California Department of   Public Health’s Gathering Guidance to limit the spread of   COVID-19,” said County Health Officer, Muntu Davis, MD,   MPH. “I know that it will significantly impact the lives   of our residents and businesses. But, without a specific   vaccine or treatment, these community mitigation   strategies are the only and most readily available tools   we have to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect the   health and well-being of our communities in LA County."    <P>
  Community mitigation efforts include social distancing   and temporary closures. Social distancing strategies   increase distance between people in specific settings   where people commonly come into close contact with one   another.  Closures refer to the temporary closures of   specific settings where people gather, and act to enhance   efforts to implement social distancing.    <P>
The Health Officer's Order specifically requires that:    <P>
<ul><li>Events and gatherings of 50 members or more are   prohibited at least until April 1, 2020.  <ul><li>This order applies to conferences, arenas, stadiums,   convention centers, and meeting spaces.  These are places   where persons, often strangers, sit and remain in close   proximity of one another for extended periods of time.</ul></ul>  <ul><li>For all public and private events and gatherings of   10-49 persons, the Health Officer requires that event   organizers and venue operators to do the following:  <ul>Enforce social distancing measures by requiring   attendees or groups of attendees, such as a group of   family members or household contacts, who remain at the   event to be separated by a distance of at least six feet   during the entirety of the event or gathering.  <li>Provide access to hand washing facilities with soap   and water or hand sanitizer that contains at least 60   percent alcohol.  <li>Post a conspicuous sign at the entry of the event or   gathering that instructs persons that have symptoms of   respiratory illness to not attend.  <li>Adhere to cleaning and infection control guidance   provided by Public Health.</ul></ul>  <ul><li>The Order specifically requires the closure of   bars and nightclubs that do not serve food, gyms, fitness   centers, movie and performance theaters, bowling alleys   and arcades.  <li>This Order does not supersede any stricter limitation   imposed by a local public entity within the Los Angeles   County.  Certain activities are essential to the functioning of   the County and the well-being of our residents and must   continue. This Order does not apply to sites and   situations where people obtain essential services and   essential goods to meet their basic needs, such as:  <ul><li>Regular school classes, work, or essential   services locations.  <li>Grocery stores or retail stores.  <li>Pharmacies.  <li>Places of transit, like airports, metro stations, or   bus stations.  <li>Hospitals or health care facilities.  <li>Schools and universities/colleges.  <li>Congregate living situations, including dormitories.  </ul></ul>  Both the State and County Public Health have provided   infection control guidance to facilities and businesses   not covered by this order.    <P>
Public Health has issued the following guidance during   this time of increased spread:  <ul><li>Avoid non-essential travel, public gatherings,   and places where large groups of people congregate.  <li>Event organizers postpone or cancel non-essential   gatherings of 50 or more until at least the end of March.  <li>Limit gatherings of individuals who are at higher   risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (people older than   65, pregnant women, and those with chronic illness) to no   more than 10 people.  <li>This guidance does not apply to activities such as   attendance at regular school classes, work, or essential   services, including public transportation, airport travel   or shopping.  <li>If you are mildly sick with a fever, stay home and   call your doctor if you are concerned and/or your   symptoms worsen. Individuals who are elderly, have   underlying health conditions or pregnant should consider   contacting their providers earlier when they are sick.  <li>Exclude employees and visitors with any fever and/or   respiratory infection symptoms and visitors with recent   travel to any country or region with significant   community transmission (including communities in the US)   from all schools, businesses, and gatherings of any size.  <li>Follow all social distancing recommendations issued   by Public Health.</ul>    <P>
